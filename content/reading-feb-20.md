## Internal Newsletter

Short one this time. Send me more interesting stuff. Better yet, I will probably move the newletter repo in the naymspace group so everyone can add stuff via merge request.

### Tech News

- **[The pinebook pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/)** looks like a very interesting laptop. Could be a perfect balance between quality and price. It runs an ARM processor though, so you should use it with Archlinux ;)
- Every thought about which stack to use when you need to update **[50 terabyte with 5000+ transactions per second](https://medium.com/adyen/updating-a-50-terabyte-postgresql-database-f64384b799e7)**? This might be an interesting read for you.
- **[Polyplot](https://polyplot.io/gm/)** promises to be a new way to read a story. It sound similar to the _choose your own adventure_ books from our childhood but a little more interesting. Haven't read it yet but I will definetely try it. (It's german, Frank Rieger from the CCC is involved).
- **[Timezones](https://www.theverge.com/science/2020/1/14/21064180/time-zones-jet-lag-daylight-savings-time-chronobiology-health-impact-verge-science-video)** are not only annoying for us as devs, but also pretty problematic for every day live situations for a lot of people.
- **[This story](https://www.nrk.no/chasing-climate-change-1.14859595)** about climate change in Norway is not going lighten your mood. But apart from the content, this page is pretty impressive if you look and the design and layout. A very impressive way to tell your story.
