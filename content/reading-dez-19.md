## Internal Newsletter 

Here we have the second newsletter, this time it has a little more content. One question to you all, would you prefer this to be written in german? I don't really care. I just default to english to improve my skills (and maybe yours), but I agree that this might be annoying and make people not read it. Let me know your opinion.

### Tech News

* __[Efficient js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff4fgQxPaO0)__, don't laugh. Apparently `let x = JSON.parse('{"bla": 3}');` is better then `let x = { bla: 3 };` in regards to performance. Who knew.
* __[Build process optimizations](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2019/12/08/on2-again-now-in-wmi/)__, but on steroids. Kind of.
* __[Nice](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/new-features-of-javascript-that-we-can-use-soon-or-now-6199981bd2f)__, shiny new javascript features. ES2020 seems to have some nice new features. My favorite is the `optional chaining operator`
* __[Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home)__ is an interesting "game". It is a very literal interpretation of the concept of gamification. You level up your character by completing your todos, forming new habbits or just doing chores. Probably not something you will use for a long time, but interesting to take a look at.
* __[AOC](https://adventofcode.com/)__ is going strong again this year. The tasks are all space related and quite interesting, not only in regards of the computational problem.
* __[Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)__ is a "React-based UI toolkit" providing all sorts of UI elements to quickly build your React app. Kevin has worked with this on the TED frontend and described it as very well thought out ~~and nicely documented~~. Worth taking a look at if you are working with React.

### Internal

* Naymspace does more OpenSource. We are close to releasing our first open source project, the mattermost kickerbot. Only things left is picking the right license and getting gitlab and github to sync nicely.
* We had our anual review with ~~homemade~~ officemade cookies. Interesting was the overview of all the projects we worked in this year and getting a feeling for the revenue the company makes.
* Kilian told us some helpfull tips about leading and participating in efficient meetings. One thing we should try is designating a moderator for certain meetings to ensure a smooth flow of the discussion and to help keep track of the agenda. Also we should always have an agenda. One thing everyone can work on is what the six hat method is for. You can read about it in [Kilians slides](https://nx3361.your-storageshare.de/s/SknxLA5azaXmfqj).
* Our new website has seen some improvements after the launch. There is still some stuff to do but we are on a good track.
